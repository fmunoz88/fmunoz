## Brackets Selections

A [Brackets](http://brackets.io) extension that adds Sublime Text style selections to Brackets. 

This extension enables you to select the text between matching brackets and parens or the current indentation level.
It also enables you to select everything from the current position to the start or the end of the document which, stangely enough, is not possible in Brackets out of the box.

## Installation

* Select **File > Extension Manager...** (or click the "brick" icon in the toolbar)
* Search for "Brackets Selections"
* or:
* Click **Install from URL...**
* Enter the url of this repo
  * https://github.com/DannyMoerkerke/brackets-selections
* Click **Install**

## How to use

Press "Ctrl-Shift-M" to select the text between matching brackets or parens. When repeatedly pressing "Ctrl-Shift-M" the selection will expand to the surrounding brackets or parens.

Press "Ctrl-Shift-J" to select the indentation level from the current cursor position. When repeatedly pressing "Ctrl-Shift-J" the selection will expand to the preceding indentation level, provided your code is properly indented.

Press "Ctrl-Shift-Up" or "Ctrl-Shift-Down" to select everything from the current cursor position to the start or the end of the document.
