File Navigation Shortcuts for Brackets
======================================
Adds Eclipse-style keyboard navigation to switch between open files:

* Press Ctrl-Shift-E (⌘⇧E on Mac) to use Quick Open with just the "Working Files" list (type part of a file name and press Enter to open it).
    * While the standard Quick Open command searches _all_ files in your project, this is filtered to only search open files (the "Working Files" list).
* Press Ctrl-[ or Ctrl-] (⌘⇧[ or ⌘⇧] on Mac) to switch to the next/previous file in the "Working Files" list.
    * While the standard Ctrl-Tab shortcut navigates in MRU order, this navigates in the exact order shown in the "Working Files" list.
    * Keep Ctrl (or ⌘⇧) held down to skip past files without moving them to the front of the MRU order (just like the standard Ctrl-Tab).
